# About Me

Hey! I'm **[Your Name]**, a cybersecurity student with a deep curiosity for how things work—and how they break.  
My main interests lie in **reverse engineering**, **malware analysis**, and exploring the inner workings of software through a low-level lens.

## 🎓 My Background

I began my journey into cybersecurity through self-study, capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions, and hours spent disassembling binaries just to understand what makes them tick.  
What started as a fascination with computer internals quickly evolved into a focused passion for:

- 🔍 Analyzing malware
- 🧠 Decoding obfuscation techniques
- 🧩 Reverse engineering executables to uncover their true behavior

I'm currently pursuing _[your degree or certification]_ and actively building my skills in:

- 🛠️ Static and dynamic malware analysis  
- 🧬 Assembly language and low-level debugging  
- 🪟 Windows internals & API behavior  
- 🧰 Tooling with Ghidra, IDA Free, x64dbg, and more  
- 🐍 Writing Python and C for automation and exploit development

## 📚 What This Blog Is About

This blog is my space to document the things I learn—from dissecting malware samples to building analysis environments and developing custom scripts.  
It serves as a living portfolio of challenges I’ve faced, problems I’ve solved, and skills I’m sharpening along the way.

Whether you're a fellow student, a professional, or just cybersecurity-curious, I hope you’ll find useful knowledge and maybe a new perspective through my posts.
