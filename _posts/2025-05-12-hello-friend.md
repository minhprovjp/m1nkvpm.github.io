**Welcome to My Cybersecurity Journey**

Hi there, and welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a passionate cybersecurity student diving deep into the fascinating worlds of reverse engineering, malware analysis, and all things offensive security. This blog serves as both a personal learning journal and a resource hub where I document techniques, tools, challenges, and insights from my hands-on experiences.

Whether you're just starting out, sharpening your skills, or exploring the darker corners of binary code and obfuscated malware, I hope you'll find value in the walkthroughs, write-ups, and reflections I share here. Expect content ranging from static and dynamic analysis, unpacking malicious binaries, CTF challenges, to tips for setting up your own lab environment.

Join me on this evolving path—let’s learn, break, and build together in the name of better security.
